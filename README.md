claim is hearsay. Dwarves are often fighting for claims full of starmite they argue is rightfully theirs for the taking. One of the main conflicts in the larger war for the rare material

## Elves

Elves are largely attributed to the discovery of starmite, having display cases of different proto artifacts made towards the end of the iron age and skeletal remains have been found near different old 
starmite locations. However the legimacy of these skeletal remains has been brought into question as they were possibly tamptered with having wear that doesnt align with the location they were found.
Elves are defending their starmite deposts from other attacking factions that keep their civilation from crumbling.
